## Tech

Python | Tableau | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Vega-Altair | Streamlit 

## Data

The dataset for the CRNY data visualization competition contains data from two sources. The first is data from the application that potential program enrollees completed to apply for the CRNY Guaranteed Income (GI) for Artists program. It includes information for all individuals who applied, regardless of whether they were ultimately accepted into the program.

The second data source is the Portrait of Artists survey which CRNY administered with the goal of understanding the needs, circumstances, and experiences of artists in New York.


## Methodology

1 - Preprocessing: We performed preprocessing on the dataset to normalize the data and merge columns from the two sources providing similar information.

2 - Visualization: We used libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and vega-altair to produce visually appealing graphs, ranging from bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.

3 - Dashboard: We created an interactive data visualization dashboard to showcase the analyzed data using Streamlit.
